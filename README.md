My plover customizations

These are my custom dictionaries/scripts that I use.

This is mainly to be used for my own personal backup but anyone else is free to use it too.

plov.ahk is a simple script for AutoHotKey for switching Plover input on/off with ctrl+/ or F1
F2/F3 is back/forward (ctrl left or right), and F4 is backspace. I don't use this anymore but I'm sure someone else will find it useful. 


Custom Dict notes:
- removed all 1+ word briefs
- fixed fingerspelling
- combined mispelling and mistakes and typey type
- change all KAUPB to KOPB | con
- change all TKAOE/ to TKE/ | de
- change all TAOU/ to TU/ | tu
- removed a whole bunch of 2-3 letter 'words' that were making fingerspelling impossible
