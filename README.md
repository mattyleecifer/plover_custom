My plover customizations

These are my custom dictionaries/scripts that I use.

This is mainly to be used for my own personal backup but anyone else is free to use it too.

The definitions in user.json are the words I've come across where the original Plover brief didn't make sense to me or I just couldn't work it out. 

plov.ahk is a simple script for AutoHotKey for switching Plover input on/off with ctrl+/ or F1
F2/F3 is back/forward (ctrl left or right), and F4 is backspace. I don't use this anymore but I'm sure someone else will find it useful. 


Custom Dict notes:

- removed all 1+ word briefs
- fixed fingerspelling
- combined mispelling and mistakes and typey type
- change all KAUPB to KOPB | con
- change all TKAOE/ to TKE/ | de
- change all TAOU/ to TU/ | tu
- I just want some consistency in my experience. Why are some briefs like that but not others? I don't want to memorize everything, I want to quickly work it out subconsciously.

The custom dict is dict.json plus the misspellings and mistakes dicts. I removed all the multi word briefs. I am really new to steno, but from what I see, a lot of it is super personal and even accents come into play.

With this view, I think the best approach is to start with a more basic dict and build from there. If it comes to it, I would learn the briefs I need faster if I wrote them myself. The extra ones are just making it hard to learn.

Also, I don't get why some words in the original dict have KAUPB for con... But only for some words and not others? Where's the consistency? So I fixed that. Now they are all KOPB. Someone tell me why this is a bad idea, or maybe I'll find out myself.
