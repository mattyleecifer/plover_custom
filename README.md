# plover_custom
My plover customizations

These are my custom dictionaries/scripts that I use.

This is mainly to be used for my own personal backup but anyone else is free to use it too.

The user.json dict is mainly spellings that I think are correct but somehow don't show up in the main dictionaries/typey type ones. 

My goal with this isn't to create briefs, but to be able to 'work out' anything I need.

plov.ahk is a simple script for AutoHotKey for switching Plover input on/off with ctrl+/
