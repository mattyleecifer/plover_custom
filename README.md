# plover_custom
My plover customizations

These are my custom dictionaries/scripts that I use.

This is mainly to be used for my own personal backup but anyone else is free to use it too.

The definitions in user.json are the words I've come across where the original Plover brief didn't make sense to me or I just couldn't work it out. 

plov.ahk is a simple script for AutoHotKey for switching Plover input on/off with ctrl+/ or F1
F2/F3 is back/forward (ctrl left or right), and F4 is backspace.
